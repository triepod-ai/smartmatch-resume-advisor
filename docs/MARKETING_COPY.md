Our platform uses the same technology as ChatGPT to understand context and meaning. Upload your resume, paste a job description, and get an instant analysis with percentage match, gap identification, and actionable improvement suggestions.

### **2-Minute Demo Script**
"Let me show you how SmartMatch revolutionizes resume optimization. Here's a software engineer's resume and an ML engineer job posting. [Upload files] In just 4 seconds, SmartMatch analyzes both documents using advanced AI. Look at this: 68% match score, 15 matching keywords highlighted in green, 8 critical gaps in red. But here's the magic - specific improvement suggestions: 'Add PyTorch experience to projects section,' 'Include MLOps pipeline development in recent role.' This isn't just keyword scanning - it's semantic understanding. The AI knows that 'machine learning' and 'ML' are the same, that 'Python development' relates to 'data science.'
