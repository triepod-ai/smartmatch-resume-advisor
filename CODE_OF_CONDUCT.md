# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an accessible, inclusive, and equitable environment where people with disabilities can fully participate without barriers. This includes recognizing and addressing ableism, ensuring accessible communication and tools, and promoting disability justice in all aspects of our project. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, with a focus on removing societal barriers to participation for people with disabilities.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people, including actively listening to and accommodating accessibility needs.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences, including those shaped by disabilities.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback, especially on accessibility improvements.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community, including ensuring equitable access for all.
- Using person-first or identity-first language as preferred by individuals, and providing accessible formats for communications (e.g., alt text for images, captions for videos).

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Ableist language or behavior, such as using disabilities as metaphors (e.g., "blind to the issue"), dismissing accessibility requests, or assuming needs without asking.
- Failing to provide accessible contributions, such as submitting code or documentation without considering screen reader compatibility or color contrast.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting, including behaviors that marginalize or exclude people with disabilities.

## Accessibility and Inclusion Commitments

To promote disability inclusion and accessibility in our open source project:

- We commit to following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and other accessibility standards in our code, documentation, and communications.
- All project materials, including videos, images, and documents, will include accessibility features such as captions, transcripts, alt text, and easy-to-read formats.
- We will use inclusive language that avoids jargon, stereotypes, or ableist terms, and adopt a human rights-based approach focusing on removing barriers rather than individual impairments.
- Community events and meetings will be designed with accessibility in mind, including providing sign language interpretation, real-time captioning, and alternative participation methods (e.g., text-based options).
- We encourage consultation with people with disabilities and organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) for feedback on project features and practices.
- Reporting mechanisms for Code of Conduct violations will be accessible, offering multiple formats (e.g., anonymous forms, email) and accommodations as needed.
- We will budget and plan for reasonable accommodations in project activities to ensure full participation.

These commitments aim to create a project that benefits everyone, recognizing that accessible design improves usability for all users.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Enforcement processes will be conducted in an accessible manner, providing accommodations as requested.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at contact@smartmatchresume.com. Reports can be submitted in accessible formats, and we will provide accommodations for the reporting process as needed. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
